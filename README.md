# Astronomy Projects with Python
Welcome! In this GitHub repo, you can view a collection of the many astrophysics project I have worked on using Python. 

To learn more about the projects, please check their respective directories. 

I took inspiration from various online sources to make my projects; references for a particular project can be found in its directory. The directory for each project also contains the code used to make the project, figures/images, and any data files used in the project.
