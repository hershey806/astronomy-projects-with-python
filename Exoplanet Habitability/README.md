### Add brief research paper, add sources, add more info about each file in project ###

### add link to dataset, note that it might not yield same results bc it gets updated, explain that its too big to put in github ###

## Introduction

In this project, I analyzed a large database of exoplanets to determine what characteristics of an exoplanet favor habitability. To do this, I calculated each exoplanet's host starâ€™s bolometric luminosity to determine the inner and outer bounds of its Circumstellar Habitable Zone (CHZ) and see if the exoplanet was within it. If it was, I deemed the exoplanet to be habitable. I then analyzed several key attributes of the habitable exoplanets visually using histograms, which can be seen in the figures directory. 

## Data


## Results

A brief summary of the results of my research (excluding figures) is shown below. 

Total number of unique exoplanets: 5045  
Number number of habitable exoplanets: 55  
Number number of not habitable exoplanets: 880  
Number of exoplanets whose habitability could not be determined (CND): 4110  
Number of exoplanets whose host star's luminosity could not be determined (part of CND): 681
