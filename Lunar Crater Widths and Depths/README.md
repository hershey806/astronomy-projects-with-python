# Using Amateur Astronomy To Esimate the Width and Depth of Lunar Craters

## Overview of Project

In this project, I was able to estimate the width and depth of several lunar craters usng only a photo of the Moon and some mathematics.

To calculate the width of craters, I measured the widths in pixels and then used trigonometry to find the widths in kilometers.

To calculate the depth of craters, I specifically analyzed craters near the Moon's terminator because they had a visible shadow. I measured the width of the shadow of each crater in pixels and kilometers, and then used trigonometry to relate the width of the shadow and crater to the depth of the crater. 

You can find more details about my methods and code in ***Lunar_Craters.ipynb***. 

## Data and Figures

***Lunar_Craters_Data.pdf*** contains tables that show my estimates of the widths and depths of several craters. The actual widths and depths of the craters are also shown for comparison. Overall, my estimations were fairly accurate; none of my estimates differed significantly from the actual values. 

***Moon.jpg*** is the image of the Moon I captured and used as a baseline for the project.

***Moon_Annotated.png*** is an image in which I labeled some of the lunar craters that I used for the project, along with some of the lunar maria.

## Conclusion and Significance

This project was important to me because it showed me that I could do big things with amateur astronomy equipment; I only needed a smartphone camera and a basic telescope to measure the widths and depths of lunar craters over 384,000 km away!

This project was not too difficult in terms of coding; the harder part was formulating a plan and gathering information to estimate the widths and depths of the craters. However, I did learn how to use Skyfield, a Python package for calculating positions of objects relative to Earth. I will likely be using Skyfield in the future, so this project was helpful for learning the basics of Skyfield.
