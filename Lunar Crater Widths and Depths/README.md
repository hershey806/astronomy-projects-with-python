# Using Amateur Astronomy To Esimate the Width and Depth of Lunar Craters

## Overview of Project

In this project, I was able to estimate the width and depth of several lunar craters usng only a photo of the Moon and some mathematics.

To calculate the width of craters, I measured the widths in pixels and then used trigonometry to find the widths in kilometers.

To calculate the depth of craters, I specifically analyzed craters near the Moon's terminator because they had a visible shadow. I measured the width of the shadow of each crater in pixels and kilometers, and then used trigonometry to relate the width of the shadow and crater to the depth of the crater. 

You can find more details about my methods and code in ***Lunar_Craters.ipynb***.
