# Exploring the Theory Behind Sunspots and Utilizing Them to Determine the Rotation Period of the Sun

## Overview of Project

In this project, I explored one of the Sun's most recognizable features: sunspots. Sunspots are areas on the Sun's photosphere that are darker and cooler than their surroudings. Monitoring sunspots allows us to understand how and why solar flares occur. In this project, however, I analyzed the motion of sunspots primarily to determine how the Sun's rotation period changes with latitude.
