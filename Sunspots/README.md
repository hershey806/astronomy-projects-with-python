# Exploring the Theory Behind Sunspots and Utilizing Them to Determine the Rotation Period of the Sun

## Overview of Project

In this project, I explored one of the Sun's most recognizable features: sunspots. Sunspots are areas on the Sun's photosphere that are darker and cooler than their surroudings. Monitoring sunspots allows us to understand how and why solar flares occur. In this project, however, I analyzed the motion of sunspots primarily to determine how the Sun's rotation period changes with latitude. 

My project consisted of three main parts:

1. I tracked the x and y coordinates of several sunspots and created a graph of their motion over time. I used this graph to calculate the rotational period of the Sun at various latitudes. For more details about my code and methodology, see the ***sunspots.ipynb*** notebook. 

2. I explored the theory behind the movement of sunspots. Specifically, 

3. I created a machine learning algorithm to automatically detect and track sunspots.
