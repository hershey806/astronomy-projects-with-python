# Ring Dynamics: Visualizing the Roche limit, Identifying Resonances, and Analyzing Shepherd Moons #

## Overview of Project ##

In this project, I used the ***rebound*** package to visualize an N-body simulation (a simulation of many particles under the influence of gravity and other forces). Specifically, I created a simulation to analyze what happens when a moon approaches the Roche limit of its parent body (Saturn, in this case).
