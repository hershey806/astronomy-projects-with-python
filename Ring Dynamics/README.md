# Ring Dynamics: Visualizing the Roche limit, Identifying Resonances, and Analyzing Shepherd Moons #

## Overview of Project ##

This project consisted of 3 main parts:

1. I used the ***rebound*** package to visualize an N-body simulation (a simulation of many particles under the influence of gravity and other forces). Specifically, I created a simulation to analyze what happens when a moon approaches the Roche limit of its parent body (Saturn, in this case). This was the main part of this project. 

2. I used a dataset to analyze resonsnces between Saturn's moons ring particles. Using Kepler's Third Law and information about the resonances (ratio of orbital periods), I was able to determine the location of several resonances in Saturn's rings and identify the features that corresponded to them. For example, I determined that the 2:1 resonance with the moon Mimas corresponded to the Cassini Division!

3. Lastly, I briefly examined the effect of moons on Saturn's rings. I analyzed how Saturn's moons can create bending waves and density waves in its rings, and how some of Saturn's moons act as shepherd moons.
