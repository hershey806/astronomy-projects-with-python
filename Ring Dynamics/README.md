# Ring Dynamics: Visualizing the Roche limit, Identifying Resonances, and Analyzing Shepherd Moons #

## Overview of Project ##

This project consisted of 3 main parts:

1. I used the ***rebound*** package to visualize an N-body simulation (a simulation of many particles under the influence of gravity and other forces). Specifically, I created a simulation to analyze what happens when a moon approaches the Roche limit of its parent body (Saturn, in this case). This was the main part of this project. You can find more details about my code and methodology in the ***ringDynamics.ipynb*** notebook. 

2. I used a dataset to analyze resonsnces between Saturn's moons ring particles. Using Kepler's Third Law and information about the resonances (ratio of orbital periods), I was able to determine the location of several resonances in Saturn's rings and identify the features that corresponded to them. For example, I determined that the 2:1 resonance with the moon Mimas corresponded to the Cassini Division! You can find more details about my code and methodology in the ***ringDynamics.ipynb*** notebook. 

3. Lastly, I briefly examined the effect of moons on Saturn's rings. I analyzed how Saturn's moons can create bending waves and density waves in its rings, and how some of Saturn's moons act as shepherd moons. 

## Data and Figures ##

I didn't use a specific source of data for the main part of this project; the rebound package had everything I needed to set up the simulation. I was able to "snapshot" the simulation at various stages, after which I combined the images to create a gif: ***roche_Limit.gif***, which you can find in the ***figures*** directory.
